In this report, we are going to describe our java project, the current state, and the objectives that we want to achieve. 
First of all, we are programming our version of "Space Invaders", and currently we already have a starting board with
information to start the game, then when we press "SPACE", it starts, and we can see two lines just for design,
a player ship, that moves to the right/left, and shoot up, then we have the Aliens that shoot down in a random way,
and moves first to the right limit of the board, and then to the left limit, and keeps going, then we have information
corresponding to the score (when a ship bullet hits an enemy, the scores increases 100), to the level (when we kill all
aliens on the board, the level increases 1), and finally, to the lives of the player ship (it starts with three and when
 an enemy bullet hits the player ship decreases 1, when we have 0 lives, the game ends and the loss board starts.

Future objectives:
- Loop when we lose the game (Loop that allows us to come back to the starting page when we lose the game);
- Code Smells on Tests (We repeat the constructor too many times, it would be better to do it before the Tests);
- Add fontforge to Aliens (We will discuss if we want to design more elements);
- Create menuWin and menuWinView classes;
- Make the game run without pressing any key;
- Change the ship hit-box, because the shots are just hitting in the middle of the ship;
- Add music to the game;

And that's how our game it's going!
